# Task Tracker - CLI

Task Tracker is a simple CLI tool to help track and manage tasks. This tool can update, delete, and mark tasks as "todo", "in-progress", or "done", whilst storing them in a ~~JSON~~ tasks.db file. 

I am making this project, as I would like a local to-do list that is configured for my needs, and is able to run through a terminal.

### MVP Features:
- **Add**: Create new tasks with a unique ID and description
- **Update Tasks**: Modify task description
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by ID
- **Mark Task Status**: Set tasks as "in-progress" or "done"
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter by status
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in a ~`tasks.json`~ `tasks.db` file in current directory

### Requirements:
- Libraries used in `requirements.txt`
- Uses positional command-line arguments for user inputs
- Stores tasks in a ~~JSON~~ database file, created automatically if it doesn't exist
- Handles errors gracefully

### tasks.json Properties
- `id`: Unique identfier for each task - integer
- `description`: Short task description - string
- `status`: Current status (`todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`)
- createdAt: Creatio timestamp - datetime object
- updatedAt: Last update timestamp - datetime object

### Usage
Run the CLI from terminal using python main.py
`Enter command:`  **insert command and arguments**
